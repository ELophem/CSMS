# CSMS (Charging Station Management System)

## Context 
This project began it's development life as my master's thesis at ECAM Brussels.
In the actual context of energy transition network operators want to be able to balance the electricity grid's demand. This could be done by remotely managing and monitoring charging poles. This is the main reason why this project was created: to understand how we can access the information that charging stations are exchanging through the OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol). It will only be avaiable for OCPP 2.0.1 as this is the most recent version and the parallell research work was done on this version.
